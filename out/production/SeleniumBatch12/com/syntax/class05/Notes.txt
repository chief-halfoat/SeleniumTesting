Selenium Class 5:

Handling Checkboxes and radio buttons
--if you have only one checkbox or radio button, you can just click on that element
if you have multiple choices, store them in a list and loop through them

DropDowns
Dropdown is a menu which gives up an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of dropdowns
Single select
Multiple select

Handling dropdowns
1. click on dropdown and click on the option
2. using Select class
        in order to use select class, we need to make sure that our dropdown has a select tag

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in three ways:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements, you store them inside a "container", like a List, Set..... etc

Multiple Select
