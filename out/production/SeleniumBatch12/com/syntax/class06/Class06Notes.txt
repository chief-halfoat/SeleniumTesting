Selenium Class 6 Notes:

Alerts:
Alerts are pop-up messages. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
We CANNOT proceed until it is "handled"

3 Types of Alerts:
HTML/Web-Based
    if you are able to inspect the pop-up and interact with the elements, it is a web-based or HTML alert
    We can inspect and perform needed actions
JavaScript/Browser alerts
    We can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
        We CANNOT inspect any JavaScript alerts
Windows-based
    We CANNOT handle in Selenium

Types of JS Alerts
1. Simple alert
    One option/an "Okay" button
2. Confirmation
    Either Cancel or "Okay"
3. Prompt
    Enter Text and Okay or Cancel

4 Ways to Handle JS Alerts
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 Ways to Interact with Frames
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

In Alerts, we switch to Alerts and switch back automatically
In Frames, we switch to a frame manually and we switch back manually
