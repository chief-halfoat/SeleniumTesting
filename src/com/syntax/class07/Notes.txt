Selenium Class 07

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
    In order to handle multiple windows, we will be using:
        getWindowHandle()
        getWindowHandles()

Window Handles
    unique ids that hold addresses of the unique window or tab
    approximately a 40 character alphanumeric code

Synchronization
    the process of bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level
    in this case, we are bringing our script and page-loading to the same speed level

Thread.sleep()  -- static / unconditional wait

Types of Selenium Waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait (less used)

Implicit wait
    tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
    it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
    we can say that implicit wait is a global wait
    if the element is found during the wait, the remaining time will be ignored and the code will move on

    Usually set to 20 seconds.
